### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Nathan, your project statement and plan is well-balanced: keeping that all-important time to "sip fine beverages" in the schedule is critical! After looking at your outline and hearing your description of the application in class, I think this will provide a fun and challenging application to build, while meeting the requirements of the course.  A few things:

* Consider providing a more formal overview/introduction to the project, followed by the technical details.  I'm thinking of prospective employers looking at your repository, although I know you already have a job :) 

* You have a very good start to your dev schedule. While many techniques should be included automatically in the development process, like logging and unit testing, it's a good idea to add those as regular tasks to ensure they aren't missed.

* What is your individual research topic/technology?
