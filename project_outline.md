Web based application to allow a user to keep an archive of books they have read

- connect to web service (http://www.webservicex.com/isbn.asmx) to retrieve isbn
  information with several search parameters.
- try to incorporate the webservice created by our group or some other group.

DB will store:
	- user information (name, authentication, other profile stuff)
	- book information (title, author, #pages, image of cover)
	- dates read
	- ranking out of 5
	- readers notes on the book
	* virtual fields (total pages read, total books read etc.)

-simple algorithm to recommend additional books (may also use ws)

-support multiple users
-allow users to send each other messages and posts.
